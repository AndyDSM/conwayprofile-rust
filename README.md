# conwayprofile-rust
Generate hashed Game of Life patterns from the command line

There's a portable .exe in the root folder

Pop that in any directory, go to it in cmd and run conwayprofile

Two optional arguments, the first is a string to hash from, the second is the size of the gif

E.g. `conwayprofile random_string 15`
